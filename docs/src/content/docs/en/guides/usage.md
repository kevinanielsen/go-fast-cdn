Go-fast CDN has a very easy to use interface which will be served on the root of the application. (If ran on your machine it will be [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/))

## API

Of course, you can also access the CDN programmatically using the API. The API documentation is currently available [here](https://go-fast-cdn.stoplight.io/docs/go-fast-cdn/ko06k96f2hywu-go-fast-cdn).
